## Sabotage
Apparently **sabotage** originated from the French word 'sabot' 
meaning 'clog' or wooden shoe. As industrialisation swept through Europe disgruntled peasants 
soon discovered that throwing a sabot into machinery was a very effective way of bringing
factories to a halt.

To ‘clog up the works’ may have a similar derivation.
