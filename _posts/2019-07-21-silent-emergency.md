## 999 + 55 SILENT EMERGENCY CALLS 
Did you know there is a 'silent' emergency call system available when you urgently require a 
police response but are unable to speak. In such circumstances, dial [999](tel:999) & when 
prompted dial 55. This tells the emergency team that you do need help but are unable to speak.
