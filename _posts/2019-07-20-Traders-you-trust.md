## TRADERS YOU CAN TRUST 'BUY WITH 'CONFIDENCE 
Be aware. There are a number of web sites and a lot of advertising material around encouraging you 
to 'trust' the trader you are thinking of employing. However, only one organisation seems to 
truly ask the searching questions of traders. That is the 'Buy with Confidence' scheme 
run by the British Government Trading Standards Department. 

To check whether the business you are thinking of using is 'up to stan-dard', first go to the 
UK Government website: [https://www.buywithconfidence.gov.uk/](https://www.buywithconfidence.gov.uk/) or call their telephone number [03454 04 05 06](tel:03454 04 05 06) 

Likewise if you are a business wanting to gain accreditation, visit the same website or telephone 
them locally on [01202-261700](tel:01202261700) or email the local trading standards office 
email <buywithconfidence@poole.gov.uk>
