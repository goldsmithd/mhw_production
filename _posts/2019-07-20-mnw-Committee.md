## MNW and YOUR COMMITTEE 
Our AGM on 22 May, unanimously re-elected Anne Lane as your Chair-man - this is her third year in 
the role. As an ex teacher this has un-doubtedly given her the experience and quiet confidence to 
address her audience in a way that exudes confidence, enthusiasm and encour-agement. We are glad to 
have her continuing support to the Community. 

## Your Committee has also changed. 

**Cllr David Brown** has moved out of the Merley area and in accordance with our constitution, 
has stepped down. David is a stalwart of the Merley community and has made a significant 
contribution to discus-sions and has influenced our decision making. He will be missed as 
a MNW Committee Member.

**Carol Brough** has also stepped down. You will all have seen her ready smile and infectious laugh 
at all meetings when you have asked for a coffee or tea. Carol has organised the catering on so 
many occasions. We are immensely grateful to her for this 'behind the scenes' job that she does 
so well. However, although she has now left the commit-tee, she has offered to continue in that 
supporting role. It must be said too, that Carol has taken an active part on your committee. We are 
most grateful to her for ideas and suggestions. 

**Cllr Richard Burton** has kindly volunteered to join our ranks. Richard was voted unanimously onto 
your Committee. We welcome him and are sure he will make a very helpful contribution. 

>As has been said before, your Committee and the work it does on your behalf is only as successful 
>as the active support you offer. **Our quorum is five and we are now down to that number.** 
>So, please contact Anne and offer your time and experience.
