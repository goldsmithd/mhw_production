## YELLOW BUSES 
Since our last Newsletter, we have received the following from one of our Sopwith Crescent Members 
who makes an important point. 

## Use it or lose it! 

>‘My wife and myself were overjoyed to discover today that Yellow Buses are to reinstate a 
>Bournemouth to Wimborne service as from 8th April 2019 by extending their number 6 
>service (which currently terminates in Bearwood) to Wimborne - 
>via Sopwith Crescent and Magna Road. In effect it is a reintroduction of their much 
>lamented 4d service, and is also to run on a 30 minute frequency every day except 
>Sunday from 7am to 7pm.  For more details see [https://www.yellowbuses.co.uk/routes/timetable/6?date=2019-08-18&direction=outbound](https://www.yellowbuses.co.uk/routes/timetable/6?date=2019-08-18&direction=outbound)

>We would like to think that this has happened as a result of the large public meeting and continuing 
>subsequent lobbying (including the efforts of both our local MPs) which followed the notice of 
>the with-drawal of the 4d service - but feel it is more likely a direct result of the start of 
>house-building on the new estates on Magna Road. But in any event it is a gift horse! 
>As the 4d experience has taught us, how-ever, these bus services are commercial enterprises 
>and "use it or lose it" must be uppermost in our thoughts. 

>So why am I writing to you about all this? It is as a follow-on to my last point : 
>we must raise public awareness and encourage folks to use this service if we are not to run 
>the risk of losing it again. But how best to do that? The Echo is not widely read in the 
>Wimborne area apparently and the tragic recent losses of both the Merley Magpie and the Stour 
>and Avon Magazine has at a stroke left the area bereft of a local news provider. Would the 
>Watch Magazine (with its excellent coverage of the area) be prepared to fill the void? I do 
>hope so, even though the subject is a little removed from its normal terms of reference.’ 

Our Member raises an important point here, are you willing to assist your Committee in 
‘filling the void’? Please contact Anne Lane on [01202-889912](tel:[01202889912) or email <admin@merley-homewatch.org.uk>
