## MNW Needs YOU
Your Committee has just **5** members! 
This is our quorum, the minimum needed at meetings to make 
decisions. This doesn’t allow for illness, accidents or holidays. 
We need more help! We hold around 6 meetings in the year and would welcome new people with fresh ideas. 

Our main aim is to help and guide the Community through safety and security advice in an effort to maintain Merley as a safe place in which to live. 
We would also like to provide information about what is going on in our area including stories about what has happened and a diary of future events. 

<span style="color:red"> Can you be the person to gather news and write “copy”? or </span>. <br>
<span style="color:red"> Can you help liaise with local businesses who want to advertise? </span>.

If you can help or just want to chat through the role please call: <br>
Anne Lane on [01202-889912](tel:[01202889912) or email <admin@merley-homewatch.org.uk>
