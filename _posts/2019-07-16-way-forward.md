## The MNW and the 'way forward' 
In our April Newsletter we said we were thinking of expanding the Watch remit to include more 
general community information. We asked for your thoughts. 

We received about a dozen responses. All were positive encouraging us to do just that. There 
were no negative replies. So, thank you to all that did respond. 

The changes we have in mind are significant. At our Coordinator Meeting on **25th September next**, 
we propose to expand on these thoughts. It should be a lively discussion. Coordinators, 
<span style="color:red"> please make time to attend.</span>
