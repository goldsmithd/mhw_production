## DORSET POLICE RECENTLY REPORTED 
“Neighbourhood Watch is light years away from the once common, and  
inaccurate, perception that it is nosey neighbours twitching curtains. 
Far from it, it is a genuinely useful and active community intelligence tool 
for the blue light services and a force for reassurance and 
cohesiveness in communities. 

For instance, Corfe Mullen, Wimborne and Colehill Home Watches have set up 
**‘crime prevention teams’**. When a crime occurs in an area that the Neighbourhood 
Policing Team think residents need to know about, they contact the Watch. 
Crime Prevention Team Volunteers are split into groups and knock on residents doors, 
tell them briefly what has happened, provide them with relevant crime prevention advice, 
encourage them to register for Dorset Alert and sign up new members. 
This is a great initiative. It is hoped to roll out to other areas of 
Dorset under the title of **Neighbourhood Reassurance Team**.”

**Merley Neighbourhood Watch is working with the Police to set up a 
Reassurance Team of our own**. We currently have 4 volunteers and invite all MNW members 
to join us in preparing for this practical crime prevention initiative. 
Merley is an area of low crime so we would hope not to be called on very often but we 
are keen to be prepared to react when the Police do need us.
