## WINDOW OF OPPORTUNITY 
It's getting warmer, but don't be tempted to leave windows and doors open in your house, 
even if you are just in another room. 1 in 3 burglaries result from homes being left insecure. 
Always lock doors and windows when leaving the house. Lock them even when you are at home but 
perhaps in the back garden or another part of the house. Don’t leave valuables on view including 
laptops and games consoles. 

Don’t hang your keys all in one place, keep them in a drawer. Make sure your sheds and 
garages are locked and secure and all tools are put away.
